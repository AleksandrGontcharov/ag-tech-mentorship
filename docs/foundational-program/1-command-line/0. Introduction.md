# Introduction and Key Concepts

A command line interface (CLI), also known as a terminal or shell, is a text-based interface used to interact with a computer's operating system or software by entering commands. Instead of using a graphical user interface (GUI) with icons and menus, a CLI requires you to type commands using a keyboard. Once entered, the computer executes the command and displays the results in the terminal window. The CLI is often used by developers, system administrators, and power users to perform tasks more efficiently and with greater control over the system.

### Reasons to learn to use the command line

- Unavoidable reality of software engineering
- Fundamental knowledge 
	- Dependency to actually make things work
	- Required if you are interested in ever collaborating with others
	- It limits you
- It can be used to be more productive
- It helps you learn how operating systems work
- Lots of very useful timeless command lines that have been built over the last 40 years: awk, grep
	- but also, it's a good investment - future-proof
- Personalize your work flow
