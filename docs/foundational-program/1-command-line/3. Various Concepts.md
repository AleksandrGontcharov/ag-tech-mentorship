## Various

* With WSL, we can start in PowerShell and type in `wsl` to get to the mounted linux directory
	* You are in a a windows directory and viewing it in linux, so the operations won't be as fast. This is usually not a problem unless you are working with operations that involve a lot of hard disk activity
* Once inside of Linux, you can type in `bash` to open another terminal within the terminal and type `exit` to go back


## Pipes with grep, awk, xargs

In Linux, a pipe (`|`) takes the output from one command and uses it as the input for another command. This allows you to string together multiple commands to perform complex tasks. I'll walk you through some simple examples using `grep`, `awk`, `sed`, and `xargs`.

**Example 1: Using `grep` and `pipe`**

Let's say you have a file named `animals.txt` that has the following lines:

```
cat
dog
mouse
elephant
zebra
catfish
```

You want to find all lines that contain the word 'cat'. You can do this using `grep` and a pipe:

```
cat animals.txt | grep 'cat'
```

This command will output:

```
cat
catfish
```

What's happening here is that `cat animals.txt` reads the file and sends the contents to `stdout` (the screen by default). The pipe `|` then takes that output and sends it as the input to `grep 'cat'`, which searches for lines containing 'cat'.

**Example 2: Using `awk` and `pipe`**

`awk` is a programming language that is designed for text processing. One common use of `awk` is to print specific fields (columns) from a file or stream of text. 

Let's say you have a file named `students.txt` with the following lines:

```
John Math A
Sarah Science B
Bill English C
```

You want to print only the names of the students. Each line is treated as a record, and the space-separated words are fields. In this case, the names (John, Sarah, Bill) are the first field. Here's how you could do it:

```
cat students.txt | awk '{print $1}'
```

This command will output:

```
John
Sarah
Bill
```

**Example 3: Using `sed` and `pipe`**

`sed` stands for "stream editor". It's often used to perform text substitutions.

Suppose you have the same `animals.txt` file as in the first example, and you want to replace 'cat' with 'lion'. Here's how you could do it:

```
cat animals.txt | sed 's/cat/lion/'
```

This command will output:

```
lion
dog
mouse
elephant
zebra
lionfish
```

Note that `sed 's/cat/lion/'` replaced 'cat' wherever it appeared, even in the middle of a word, which is why 'catfish' became 'lionfish'.

**Example 4: Using `xargs` and `pipe`**

`xargs` is a command that is used to take input and pass it as arguments to another command.

For example, suppose you have a directory with multiple text files and you want to find the word 'elephant' in any of them. Here's how you could do it:

```
echo *.txt | xargs grep 'elephant'
```

In this command, `echo *.txt` prints the names of all text files in the current directory, and `xargs grep 'elephant'` takes each of those file names and runs `grep 'elephant'` on it.

These are just simple examples to get you started. As you get more comfortable with these commands, you'll be able to combine them in various ways to perform more complex tasks.
