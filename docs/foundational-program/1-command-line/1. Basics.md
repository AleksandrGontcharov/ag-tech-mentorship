## Stdin vs Stdout vs Stderr

1.  **stdin (standard input)**: This is when a program asks you to type something in. For example, a game might ask you to type in your name before you start playing. When you type your name, you're providing input through stdin.
    
2.  **stdout (standard output)**: This is when a program shows you information. Let's say you're using a program to do some math homework. You type in a math problem, like "2 + 2", and the program shows you the answer, "4". The program is using stdout to show you the answer.
    
3.  **stderr (standard error)**: This is when a program tells you about a problem. Suppose you're using the same math program and you type in something that doesn't make sense, like "2 + apple". The program can't do that math problem, so it shows you an error message like "Invalid input: apple". That error message is being sent through stderr.

## Stream redirection

1.  **Redirecting stdout**: You're using a program that's creating a lot of output, and you want to save it to look at later. You can redirect the stdout to a file. Then, instead of showing up on your screen, all of the output gets saved into the file.

Here's a simple command in the command-line interface (like Terminal on a Mac or Command Prompt on Windows) that shows redirection of stdout:


```bash
echo "Hello, world!" > hello.txt
```

The `echo "Hello, world!"` part is a command that creates some output ("Hello, world!"). Normally, this output would just be shown on your screen. But the `> hello.txt` part redirects the output to a file named "hello.txt". So instead of seeing "Hello, world!" on your screen, it gets saved in the file.

2.  **Redirecting stderr**: Suppose a program might create errors, and you want to keep track of them. You can redirect stderr to a file. Then, instead of showing up on your screen, all of the error messages get saved into the file.

Here's a simple command-line command that shows redirection of stderr:


```bash
find / -name "file.txt" 2> errors.txt`
```

The `find / -name "file.txt"` part is a command that searches for a file named "file.txt". If it encounters any errors (like directories it doesn't have permission to search), it will send an error message to stderr. The `2> errors.txt` part redirects stderr to a file named "errors.txt". So instead of seeing the error messages on your screen, they get saved in the file.

1.  **Redirecting stdin**: Suppose you have a program that needs to get a lot of input, and typing it all in would take a long time. You can redirect stdin from a file. Then, instead of typing in all the input, the program gets the input from the file.

Here's a simple command-line command that shows redirection of stdin:


```bash
sort < words.txt
```

The `sort` part is a command that sorts input alphabetically. Normally, you'd have to type in all the words you want to sort. But the `< words.txt` part redirects stdin from a file named "words.txt". So instead of typing in all the words, the program gets the words from the file, and then sorts them.

## Exit codes

n Linux, an **exit code** indicates the response from the command or a script after execution. It ranges from 0 to 255. The exit codes help us determine whether a process ran:

1.  Successfully.
2.  Failed due to an error.
3.  Or another state that gives us an indication of an unexpected result.


Here's an example:

1.  Run a command that works:

```bash
echo "Hello, world!" 
echo $?
```


The first command prints "Hello, world!" and the second command prints the exit code of the first command. It will print `0`, which means the first command was successful.

2.  Run a command that doesn't exist:   

```bash
nonexistentcommand
echo $?
```


The first command tries to run a command that doesn't exist, and the second command prints the exit code of the first command. It will print a non-zero number (usually `127`), which means the first command failed.

I hope this helps you understand exit codes better!
