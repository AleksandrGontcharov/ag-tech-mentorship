# Introduction

A command line interface (CLI), also known as a terminal or shell, is a text-based interface used to interact with a computer's operating system or software by entering commands. Instead of using a graphical user interface (GUI) with icons and menus, a CLI requires you to type commands using a keyboard. Once entered, the computer executes the command and displays the results in the terminal window. The CLI is often used by developers, system administrators, and power users to perform tasks more efficiently and with greater control over the system.

-   stdin (standard input): This is where data can be inputted to a program or command. It's typically done through keyboard input, but can also be redirected from a file or another program.
    
-   stdout (standard output): This is where data is sent by a program or command as output. It's typically displayed in the terminal window, but can also be redirected to a file or another program.
    
-   stderr (standard error): This is where error messages or diagnostic output is sent by a program or command. It's also typically displayed in the terminal window, but can be redirected separately from stdout.

### Reasons to learn to use the command line

- Unavoidable reality of software engineering
- Fundamental knowledge 
	- Dependency to actually make things work
	- Required if you are interested in ever collaborating with others
	- It limits you
- It can be used to be more productive
- It helps you learn how operating systems work
- Lots of very useful timeless command lines that have been built over the last 40 years: awk, grep
	- but also, it's a good investment - future-proof
- Personalize your work flow

## Topics to cover

- Navigating files, folders
- standard output streams - stream redirection
- common commands; cat
- return codes/exit codes

   - Prerequisites:
       - install windows terminal
       - install latest Powershell
       - install Ubuntu 22.04
       - configure oh my posh/starting directory/font
       - Learn keyboard shortcuts for splitting terminal, Ctrl+L, Ctrl left and right, Ctrl+backspace (Linux alt+backspace, Ctrl+A) Ctrl+C, right click to paste into the terminal, 

   - cmd, Powershell, Bash 
   - Path, understand for all 3
   - practice with some commands
   - explain how to run an executable the dot slash
   - explain how to navigate directories, CD, mkdir, CD minus, pushd, popd, 
   - explain how to open a shell within a shell and exit it emgm by typing Bash or cmd or wsl
   - explain how the folders in Linux are mounted and are slower if it's windows
   - tools like justfile or make 
   - how to save commands to a file and run them (beginning of scripting)
   - aliases and cmdlets
   - bashrc and code $profile
   - basic commands: (cross platform) echo, ls, etc.
  - Command line programs
       - different styles of command line programs
       - the one you get most of the time: git, docker, etc commands, subcommands, switches
       - the ones you meet sometimes but are usually really old! 
       - Subcommands and switches style:
