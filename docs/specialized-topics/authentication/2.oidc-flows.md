### OIDC Key Terms

`Oidc Authorization Endpoint:` Used for identifying the user and asking for consent for access being requests. Features such as 2FA can be set up.

`Oidc Token Endpoint:` No user interaction, and is used to retrieve access tokens and refresh tokens. Refresh tokens are used to get new access tokens.

`ID Token:` Encapsulates the user's identity. JWT is a common way to format this token. Has an expiration for a longer duration.

`Access Token:` Used to call a web API. Has an expiration for a shorter duration.

`Refresh Token:` Because the Access token has a short expiration, and we sometimes need to get a new Access Token without user interaction, this is where the Refresh Token is used. You use the refresh token to get new access tokens at the token endpoint. Until the refresh token is invalidated, a user can keep requesting access tokens. When invalidated, you may be asked to log in again.
