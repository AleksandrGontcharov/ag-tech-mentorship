### Open Web Application Security Project Principles

- **Minimize attack surface area**: Attack surface refers to all the potential vulnerabilities a threat actor could exploit. Attack vectors are pathways that attackers use to penetrate security defenses. Examples of attack vectors:
	- Phishing emails
	- Weak passwords

Examples: Establish complex passwords, disable certain features.

- **Principle of least privilege**: Users have the least amount of access required to perform their everyday tasks.

Example: Do not give engineers owner access on Azure subscriptions.

- **Defense in depth**: Organizations should have varyingÂ security controls that mitigate risks and threats.

Example: MFA, Firewalls.

- **Separation of duties**: Critical actions should rely on multiple people, each of whom follow the principle of least privilege.Â 

Example: No one should be given so many privileges that they can be misuse the system.

- **Keep security simple**: Avoid unnecessarily complicated solutions. Complexity makes security difficult.Â 

- **Fix security issues correctly**: When security incidents occur, identify the root cause, contain the impact, identify vulnerabilities, and conduct tests to ensure that remediation is successful.
