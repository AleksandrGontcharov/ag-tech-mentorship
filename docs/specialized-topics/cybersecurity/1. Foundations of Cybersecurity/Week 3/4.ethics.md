### Ethical Principles in Security

`Confidentiality:` Example: You will encounter PII, it's your ethical duty to keep it secure and safe.

`Privacy protection:` Safeguarding personal information from unauthorized use.
Example: Your colleague requests a colleague's personal phone number.

`Law:` Example: Consider a staff member at a hospital who has personal files and leaves files unsupervised and doesn't lock them. Upon return, the files are missing.
