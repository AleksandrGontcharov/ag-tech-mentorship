`Security Frameworks:` Guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risk and threats to data and privacy.

Security frameworks are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy. Security frameworks provide a structured approach to implementing a `security lifecycle`. The security lifecycle is a constantly evolving set of policies and standards that define how an organization manages risks, follows established guidelines, and meets regulatory compliance, or laws.

`Purpose of security frameworks:`
* Protecting PII
* Securing financial information
* Identifying security weaknesses
* Managing organizational risks
* Aligning security with business roles


### Four Core Components of Security Frameworks

1. Identifying and documenting security goals
2. Setting guidelines to achieve security goals
3. Implementing strong security processes
4. Monitoring and communicating results 

`Security Controls:` Safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks.
* Example: completing a privacy training.
