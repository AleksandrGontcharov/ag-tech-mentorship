# ðŸ’€ SIEM tools

`Log:` A record of events that occur within an organization's systems.

* Example: Records of employees signing into their computers

`SIEM Tools:` A SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) tool analyzes log data to monitor critical activities in an organization. SIEM tools collect real-time, or instant, information,Â and allow security analysts toÂ identify potential breaches as they happen.

### Commonly used SIEM tools

`Splunk:`  Splunk is a data analysis platform, and Splunk Enterprise provides SIEM solutions. Splunk Enterprise is a self-hosted tool used to retain, analyze, and search an organization's log data.

`Chronicle:` Another SIEM tool is Google's Chronicle. Chronicle is a cloud-native SIEM tool that stores security data for search and analysis. 

Both of these SIEM tools, and SIEMs in general, collect data from multiple places, then analyze and filter that data to allow security teams to prevent and quickly react to potential security threats.
