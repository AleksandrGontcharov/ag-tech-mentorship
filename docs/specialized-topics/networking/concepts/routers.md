# ➡️ Routers
___

A `router` is a networking device that connects multiple networks and directs data traffic between them by forwarding data packets to their intended destinations. Routers operate at the network layer and use IP addresses to identify network devices and determine the best path for data to travel. Routers also provide additional functionality such as network address translation (NAT), security, and quality of service (QoS) to manage network traffic.

-   `Network Address Translation (NAT)`: NAT is a technique used by routers to translate private IP addresses into public IP addresses, allowing devices on a private network to access the Internet using a single public IP address. NAT also provides a layer of security by hiding the IP addresses of devices on the private network from the Internet.

While NAT is commonly used to translate private IP addresses to public IP addresses, it can also be used to map IP addresses between different networks or to map incoming traffic to specific services or resources on a private network.

-   `Security`: Routers provide a range of security features to protect networks from unauthorized access and attacks. These features include firewall protection, which filters incoming and outgoing traffic based on a set of rules, and virtual private network (VPN) support, which allows remote users to securely connect to a private network over the Internet.

-   `Quality of Service (QoS)`: QoS is a feature that allows routers to prioritize certain types of traffic over others, ensuring that high-priority traffic (such as video or voice) is given priority over lower-priority traffic (such as email or file transfers). QoS helps ensure that network resources are used efficiently and that high-priority applications receive the bandwidth they require to function properly.
