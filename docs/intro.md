# Welcome

---

Welcome to the AG Tech Mentorship Community! 

A supportive community of friends helping each other, sharing ideas, lessons, and mentorship.

### Why was this group created? 

My name is Aleksandr Gontcharov (I am AG!) and I started this group because I believe that mentorship and support is a rare gift that can change your life. It is also a way for me to give back to the community! I am a big believer in upward mobility through hard work, perseverance, strategy, and support from others. No matter where you are, whether already a seasoned professional, an aspiring tech wizard, or a hobbyist, you are welcome here. 

### How does this group meet?

We meet virtually on Saturdays at 10am to 12pm PDT.

### Is this group for me?

This is for you if any of the following reasons appeal to you!

* You want to meet inspiring people and build your network in tech and get tips on career, resumes, and fundamental skills in tech.
* You strive to become a real professional in tech and master the essential tools and skills that will serve you for years to come 
* You want to participate with like-minded supportive people and make friends with similar interests 
* You prefer hands-on learning through workshop style events and one-on-one mentorship 
* You want to share your own tips, tricks, and experience and become a mentor yourself

### What is the Foundational Program?

The foundational program consists of workshop style events where I teach fundamental skills that are important for a career in tech regardless of your specific area of specialization. Everyone is expected to know certain concepts, tools, and even expected to understand and speak certain lingo! This can be intimidating for someone new just joining and I aim to inspire confidence and help you master these fundamental skills.

### How can I join?

Feel out this [Google Form](https://forms.gle/SCR8TDa36dSCdJjHA), and we will invite you to join your first session as a "drop-in" so you can see if you like it and if you would consider joining as a regular.
